# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the data management resource list!
This guide aims to help simplify the contribution process. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this respository is to track relevant resources for data managers
doing registry-based, quantitative, medical research. Relevant resources can span a variety of
topics, including avoiding technical debt, writing good documentation and 
data management plans, coding tips, and guidance on data visualization. 
This resource list is a supplement to a research poster on technical debt in registry-based medical research ([available here](https://zenodo.org/records/15040399))

## Guidelines
- Feel free to make contributions by submitting a pull request
- Resources from other research fields are welcome if they can still be applied to registry-based medical research
- If adding a new topic with general information, please add it into the existing resources list based on where it 
falls in the [research lifecycle](https://researchsupport.harvard.edu/research-lifecycle), and add it to the table of contents
- Guidance that is specific to a certain programming language should be kept at the end of the document under its specific sub-category
(feel free to add resources for other languages, just make sure to add them to the table of contents!)

## Pull requests
Pull requests are the main way to contribute to this repository. I will evaluate whether a pull request is compatible with purpose of this repository when when deciding to merge a pull request.
